# These are three of the data analysis projects that I have completed while learning to become a Data Engineer. 
Each project has markdown sections that give context. 
Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments!
The goals of each of these projects are relatively arbitrary as they are more focused on showing off data analysis skills.
