The SQL project is a website that showed how many users were members of my fake pirate club. The site allowed visitors to enter their email, and that email would be automatically be added to a SQL database hosted on GOORMIDE. The website would then update how many users were members of the club automatically. Because the project is hosted on GOORMIDE, it does not actually work unless I manually turn on the GOORMIDE container and keep it open. I am working on finding a way to host the project through a platform that lets it stay on without having to open the GOORMIDE container.
